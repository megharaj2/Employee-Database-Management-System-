An employee database management system is an essential tool used by companies to manage the employees in their organization. It provides a central place to store any kind of records related to all the employees. Essentially, it allows HR to keep track of personnel data, such as attendance, leaves, salary, and performance, in one central location.  Companies with large workforces often rely on this tool to make sure HR runs smoothly.
